## Coding guidelines

* We use [functional components](https://betterprogramming.pub/pros-cons-of-functional-components-in-react-f52bded98db0) and [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) (not class components).
* Use single quotes instead of double quotes for consistency as this is a [slightly more popular choice](https://medium.com/@bunlong/single-quotes-vs-double-quotes-in-javascript-f224894d554f).
* File and folder names should be lowercase and separated with hyphens.
* Statements [end with semicolons](https://dev.to/adriennemiller/semicolons-in-javascript-to-use-or-not-to-use-2nli).
