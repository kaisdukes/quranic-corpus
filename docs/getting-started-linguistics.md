# Getting Started - Linguistics 

**TL;DR**: This guide assists you in participating in the Quranic Arabic Corpus 2.0 project, specifically in identifying inconsistencies in the linguistic treebank and understanding the tagging scheme.

The notes below are designed for volunteers who may not be experts in linguistics, but still want to learn and contribute. For this reason, we have tried to keep linguistic jargon and technical terms to a minimum.

### Linguistics Background

The Linguistics Team for the corpus 2.0 project has made significant progress, completing around 50% of the Quran's grammar diagrams, also known as the treebank. The Quranic Treebank follows the linguistic analysis found in *al-i’rāb al-mufassal*, maintaining a consistent reference throughout the project.

Our immediate goal is to finish the remaining half of the treebank, for which we need your invaluable assistance. However, this is just the beginning. Once we accomplish this task, our future projects include extending our work into multiple analyses per verse, semantic analysis, linking with Hadith and other corpora, and developing the ontology.

Before we can complete the remaining 50% of the grammar diagrams, we're in the process of developing an online annotation tool. This tool is being designed specifically for the unique syntactic representation used in the treebank, which uses a hybrid of both dependency and constituency grammar. This representation improves alignment with traditional *i'rab*. While our software engineers are working on this, there are plenty of ways you can assist us right now, mainly by helping to review the existing treebank.

### Step 1: Understand the Goal

The main aim of our linguistic efforts in this phase of the project is to complete the remaining 50% of the Quran's grammar diagrams (or treebank). Once this is done, we plan to expand into multiple analyses per verse, semantic analysis, and connections to Hadith, among others.

### Step 2: Help Find Inconsistencies in the Treebank

The treebank we have so far is based on the linguistic analysis in *al-i’rāb al-mufassal*. We need your help to find any inconsistencies in it. Here's how:

* Choose a chapter from the Quran, preferably a large one like *surat al-māidah*.
* Review the chapter on the corpus prototype site: https://qurancorpus.app/treebank/5
* Compare this with *al-i’rāb al-mufassal*, available online, for example here: https://motivatedsisters.com/2018/08/08/irab-al-mufassal or here: https://shamela.ws/book/150578
* Let us know on the #linguistics-help Slack channel which chapter you're reviewing for better coordination.
* Please take your time during the review process; accuracy is preferred over speed.
* Share any useful insights with the team on Slack.

Your contributions in this step will help improve the quality of the Quranic Treebank, familiarize you with the style used in *al-i’rāb al-mufassal*, and give you a better understanding of the Quranic Treebank's visualization.

### Step 3: Understand the Treebank Linguistic Tagging Scheme

Please take time to understand the tagging scheme used in the treebank. You can find more information at the following links:
