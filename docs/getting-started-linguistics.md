# Getting Started - Linguistics 

**TL;DR**: This guide assists you in participating in the Quranic Arabic Corpus 2.0 project, specifically in identifying inconsistencies in the linguistic treebank and understanding the tagging scheme.

## Step 1: Understand Our Goal

The main aim of our linguistic efforts in this project is to complete the remaining 50% of the Quran's grammar diagrams or treebank. Once this is done, we plan to expand into multiple analyses per verse, semantic analysis, and connections to Hadith, among others.

## Step 2: Help Find Inconsistencies in the Treebank

The treebank we have so far is based on the linguistic analysis in *al-I’rāb al-Mufassal*. We need your help to find any inconsistencies in it. Here's how:

* Choose a chapter from the Quran, preferably a large one like Surat Al-Māidah.
* Review the chapter on the corpus prototype site: https://qurancorpus.app/treebank/5
* Compare this with *al-I’rāb al-Mufassal*, available online, for example, here: https://motivatedsisters.com/2018/08/08/irab-al-mufassal
* Let us know on the #linguistics-help Slack channel which chapter you're reviewing for better coordination.
* Please take your time during the review process; accuracy is preferred over speed.
* Share any useful insights with the team on Slack.

Your contributions in this step will help improve the quality of the Quranic Treebank, familiarize you with *al-I’rāb al-Mufassal* style, and give you a better understanding of the Quranic Treebank's visualization.

## Step 3: Understand the Treebank Linguistic Tagging Scheme

Please take time to understand the tagging scheme used in the treebank. You can find more information at the following links:

For a deeper understanding, we recommend Chapter 6 of Dr. Dukes’ PhD thesis: *[Statistical Parsing by Machine Learning from a Classical Arabic Treebank](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.07193.pdf)*.
